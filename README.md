# School-Desegregation-Orders

Analyzing this data set: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/school-desegregation-orders-data

"Across the United States, some school districts are bound by orders to increase the racial integration of black and Latino students and improve their educational opportunities. This dataset collects information about all of those school desegregation orders, from 1957 through the end of 2014. 

The data files include information about school desegregation orders mandated by federal courts and open school desegregation orders that resulted from voluntary agreements between school districts and the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s Office of Civil Rights."

Looking for:
1. Location of the orders
<br>a. According to National Geographic, the United States is typically divided into five geographic regions: the Northeast, Southwest, West, Southeast and Midwest.
2. Number of orders by years
<br>a. Has there been more or less orders over time?
3. Where are the most, and most recent orders taking place?
4. What assumptions about segregation and location are confirmed and overturned?

## Hypothesis
We assume that the South is more discriminatory than the North, because of it's history of slavery and Jim Crow. But, while the South was forced to desegragate through mandated busing, and other federal orders, the North was allowed to quitely segregate its counties through redlining. I predict that more of the recent desegregating order will take place in states we view as liberal.
